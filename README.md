# flask-server
This repo serves as a basic Flask kit inorder to connect to a DB using sqlalchemy. In this application, I am saving, fetching and updating employee details from MySql DB which can be further used by a front end application(Angular or any other) by connecting to Flask server.

## Running the app
Run the below commands to start the Flask server

* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python run.py
